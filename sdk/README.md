# Compiler for Tekton

The Kubeflow Pipelines [SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) 
allows data scientists to define end-to-end machine learning and data pipelines.
The output of the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK compiler is YAML for [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo).
We are extending the compiler of the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to generate YAML
for [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline).

## Project Prerequisites

 - Python: `3.5.3` or later
 - Tekton: [`0.13.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
 - Tekton CLI: [`0.10.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/tag/v0.10.0)
 - Kubeflow Pipelines: [KFP with Tekton backend](/tekton_kfp_guide.md)

Follow the instructions for [installing project prerequisites](/sdk/python/README.md#development-prerequisites)
and take note of some important caveats.


## Tested Pipelines

We are [testing the compiler](/sdk/python/tests/README.md) on more than 80 pipelines
found in the Kubeflow Pipelines repository, specifically the pipelines in KFP compiler
`testdata` folder, the KFP core samples and the samples contributed by third parties.

A report card of Kubeflow Pipelines samples that are currently supported by the `kfp-tekton`
compiler can be found [here](/sdk/python/tests/test_kfp_samples_report.txt).
If you work on a PR that enables another of the missing features please ensure that
your code changes are improving the number of successfully compiled KFP pipeline samples.


## How to use the KFP-Tekton Compiler

### Installation

You can install the latest release of the `kfp-tekton` compiler from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kfp-tekton/). We recommend to create a Python
virtual environment first:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    pip install kfp-tekton
    
Alternatively you can install the latest version of the `kfp-tekton` compiler
from source by cloning the repository [https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton):

1. Clone the `kfp-tekton` repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton.git
   cd kfp-tekton
   ```

2. Setup Python environment with Conda or a Python virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Build the compiler:

   ```
   pip install -e sdk/python
   ```

4. Run the compiler tests (optional):

   ```
   make test
   ```


### Compiling a Kubeflow Pipelines DSL Script

The `kfp-tekton` Python package comes with the `dsl-compile-tekton` command line
executable, which should be available in your terminal shell environment after
installing the `kfp-tekton` Python package.

If you cloned the `kfp-tekton` project, you can find example pipelines in the
`samples` folder or under `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata` folder.

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml


### Running the Pipeline on a Tekton Cluster

After compiling the `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py` DSL script
in the step above, we need to deploy the generated Tekton YAML to our Kubernetes
cluster with `kubectl`. The Tekton server will automatically start a pipeline run
for which we can follow the logs using the `tkn` CLI. 

Here we have to deploy the pipeline in the kubeflow namespace because all the pipelines with metadata
and artifacts tracking  rely on the minio object storage credentials in the kubeflow namespace.

    kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml -n kubeflow
    
    tkn pipelinerun logs --last -n kubeflow

Once the Tekton Pipeline is running, the logs should start streaming:
      
    Waiting for logs to be available...
    
    [gcs-download : main] With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate

    [gcs-download : copy-artifacts] Added `storage` successfully.
    [gcs-download : copy-artifacts] tar: removing leading '/' from member names
    [gcs-download : copy-artifacts] tekton/results/data
    [gcs-download : copy-artifacts] `data.tgz` -> `storage/mlpipeline/artifacts/parallel-pipeline/gcs-download/data.tgz`
    [gcs-download : copy-artifacts] Total: 0 B, Transferred: 195 B, Speed: 1 B/s

    [gcs-download-2 : main] I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath

    [echo : main]
    [echo : main] Text 2: I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
    [echo : main]
      
## Build Tekton from Master

In order to utilize the latest features and functions of the `kfp-tekton` compiler,
we suggest to install Tekton from a nightly built or build it from the
[master](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#install-pipeline)
branch. Features that require a special build, different from the 'Tested Version',
will be listed below.

## Optional Features

### Compile Kubeflow Pipelines without Artifacts

By default, _artifacts_ are enabled because the KFP DSL are designed to run on Kubeflow Pipeline's engine with artifacts to be stored on
[Minio](https://docs.minio.io/) storage. When artifacts are enabled, all the output
parameters are also treated as artifacts and persisted to the default object storage.
Enabling artifacts also allows files to be downloaded or stored as artifact inputs/outputs.
Since artifacts are dependent on the Kubeflow Pipeline's deployment, the generated
Tekton pipeline must be deployed to the same namespace as Kubeflow Pipelines.

To run Tekton pipelines without installing Kubeflow pipeline, or if you need to compile the Kubeflow
Pipelines DSL without artifacts, add the `--disable-artifacts` argument to your
`dsl-compile-tekton` commands. Then, run the pipeline in the same namespace that is
used by Kubeflow Pipelines (typically `kubeflow`) by specifying the `-n` flag:

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml \
        --disable-artifacts
        
    kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml -n kubeflow
    
    tkn pipelinerun logs --last -n kubeflow

You should see log messages without any artifact reference:

    Waiting for logs to be available...
    
    [gcs-download : main] With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate
    
    [gcs-download-2 : main] I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
    
    [echo : main] Text 1: With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate
    [echo : main]
    [echo : main] Text 2: I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
    [echo : main]

## Troubleshooting

- When you encounter permission issues related to ServiceAccount, refer to
  [Servince Account and RBAC doc](sa-and-rbac.md)
  
- If you run into the error `bad interpreter: No such file or director` when trying to use
  python's venv, remove the current virtual environment in the `.venv` directory and
  create a new one using `virtualenv .venv`

- For big data passing, user need to create PV manually, or enable dynamic volume provisioning, refer to the link of: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning

  User need to create pvc manually with the pvc name same as pipelinerun name until [issue #181](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton/issues/181) addressed
